## My process

I started writing all needed HTML and adding all the content to the correct sections. Then I added needed classes to the HTML and started my SCSS file.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup (or at least I tried)
- Flexbox
- SASS

### What I learned

I learned how to correctly layout with CSS and how to use some SASS features.

### Continued development

In the next lessons, I want to focus more on how to create good layouts and SASS.

### Useful resources

- [CSS-tricks](https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-css-media-queries/) - This helped me get a better understanding of media-queries.
- [mdn web docs - CSS Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/CSS_layout) - Always a good resource to find out more about web dev topics
